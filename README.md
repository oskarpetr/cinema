# Cinema

The Cinema app offers you an opportunity to buy tickets for selected movies, with lots of additional options, including food and drinks on your ticket. The total price is based on the options you have chosen on the form page.

This application has two states - logged in and logged out. The settings on the home page are based on these two states. If the user is not registered yet, the option is again on the home page.

On the My Tickets page, it is possible to see all the tickets purchased under the account currently logged in. On the database page, you can view all the tickets that have ever been purchased.

From each page, you can exit or return to the home page by pressing the escape key.
